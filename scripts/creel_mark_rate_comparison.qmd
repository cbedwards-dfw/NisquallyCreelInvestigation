### mark rates using catch estimates

```{r}

# read in creel catch estimates for the 2023 Nisqually

# catch estimates calculated for total encounters of ALL adult Chinook
estimates_total_encounters <- readr::read_csv(here("cleaned_data/creel_estimates", "model_estimates_stratum_s1s2_total_encounters.csv"))

# catch estimates calculated for total encounters of only AD-clipped (marked) adult Chinook
estimates_ad_encounters <- readr::read_csv(here("cleaned_data/creel_estimates", "model_estimates_stratum_ad_encounters.csv"))

# bind together and filter to outputs generated with the Bayesian state space model 
combined <- estimates_total_encounters |> rbind(estimates_ad_encounters) |> 
  filter(model_type == "BSS" & estimate_category == "catch") |>  
  select(event_date = min_event_date, section_num, period, day_type, angler_final, est_cg,
         estimate_category, estimate_type, estimate_value) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    management_week = framrsquared::management_week(event_date)
  ) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = estimate_type, values_from = estimate_value)

# CE - check out the "combined" object, these are daily catch estimates grouped into two catch groups, "total encounters" - daily catch estimates (i.e., expanded for effort) aggregating Chinook catch over UM,AD,UNK mark status for both released and harvested fish, and "ad encounters" - daily catch estimates (i.e., expanded for effort) aggregating catch for only AD-clipped fish, both released and harvested. 

# CE-  can we accurately propagate error when calculating daily mark rates from these two quantities, given the statistics available?

# think about calculating study design strata level mark rates - could show that certain strata align with net data, while other do not! 

catch_totals <- combined |> 
  group_by(section_num, angler_final, est_cg) |> 
   summarise(
    total = sum(mean)
  )

# look at weekly mark rates calculated using expanded catch estimates

combined |> select(event_date, management_week, section_num, day_type, angler_final, est_cg, mean) |> 
  filter(section_num == 1) |> 
  group_by(management_week, section_num, angler_final, est_cg) |> 
   summarise(
    total = sum(mean)
  ) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = est_cg, values_from =  total) |> 
  rename(total_ad_encounters = `Chinook_Adult_AD_Kept|Released`, total_encounters = `Chinook_Adult_AD|UM|UNK_Kept|Released`) |>

# plotting by angler type, there appears to be a systematic offset between bank and boat, similar to the net vs. sport pattern??

# by viewing the data in light of the design strata, are there clues as to where potential bias are introduced in the data, regarding angler type, time period, or spatial area?

```

```{r}

# test out the use of the newly packaged up fetch_dwg function, creating a vector of the names of the Nisqually fisheries we want to pull into R

# define fisheries we want data for
